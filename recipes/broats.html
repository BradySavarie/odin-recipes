    <h2 class="headings">A High-Protein Version of Overnight Oats</h2>
    <p>
        This overnight oats recipe contains about <em><strong>60</strong> grams of protein</em> per serving in <em><strong>610</strong> calories</em>, which is amazing if you're trying to pack on some muscle. Not only is it nutritious, it's also very easy to make and contains only 4 ingredients!

        If you're not much of a morning person (I <em>certainly</em> am not), than you most likely struggle with not having enough time to make breakfast before work. I personally can't help but snooze the alarm until the last possible minute. Since this recipe is so quick to make I have found myself consistently eating breakfast again. This has helped me maintain my protein intake so that I don't waste all of my efforts in the gym while also fueling my mind and body in preparation for the rest of the day. No more shakes due to only having coffee before my lunch break.
