    <h2>A Crunchy, Satisfying Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h2>
    <p>
        I've been making this sandwich since I was tall enough to see the stovetop. It's one of the easiest, most satisfying meals on planet Earth.

        When you're in a lazy, apathetic mood you can rely on a good ole' grilled cheese to provide adequate sustenance with a minimal amount of effort. Forego the bacon if you can't be bothered (or just buy the pre-cooked stuff).
